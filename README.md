# TMDb Analysis  [![made-with-python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-1f425f.svg)](https://www.python.org/)
Investigating a dataset contains information about 10,000+ movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb).


## Project Overview

This project is connected with the [Introduction to Data Analysis](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud170) course, but depending on your background knowledge, you may not need to take the whole class to complete this project.

In this project, I will analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings about it. I will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make my analysis easier.

I will conduct my own data analysis and create a file to share that documents your findings. I will start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions I could answer using it. Then I will use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions I am most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers.


**About the dataset:**
TMDb movies data: This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
